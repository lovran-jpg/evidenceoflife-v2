## Release title

**Evidence of Life v1.0.0**

### Initial public release

Evidence of Life is a full-stack personal life management platform: plan the day,
capture what actually happened, and revisit habits, places, and memories in a
private archive you control.

### Highlights

- Today / Plan timeline with focus timers and planned-vs-actual views
- Moments with photos, places, tags, and links
- Dues, habits, sticky notes, and link hub
- Map + calendar / year recall
- Google Calendar OAuth import
- Supabase Auth + Postgres RLS + private photo storage (signed URLs)
- Synthetic public demo at `/demo-app`
- CI: typecheck, unit tests, lint, Playwright demo smoke, CodeQL, gitleaks

### Technology stack

Vite · React · TypeScript · Tailwind / shadcn · Supabase (Auth, Postgres, Storage, Edge Functions)

### Security notes for operators

Apply migrations and redeploy edge functions before relying on production
hardening. See `docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md` and `docs/oss/self-hosting.md`.
