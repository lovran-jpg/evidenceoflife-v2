**A full-stack personal life management platform** for planning the day, capturing what actually happened, and revisiting habits, places, and memories — privately, without a social feed.

> Not therapy. Evidence of a life well-lived.

Additional captures (map, calendar, habits) can be added under [`docs/screenshots/`](docs/screenshots/). See that folder for naming guidelines. Prefer the synthetic `/demo-app` so no real personal data is published.

## Overview

**Problem.** Most productivity apps remember what you *planned*. Journals wait for you to rewrite what *happened*. Between calendars, timers, photos, and chat history, ordinary days become hard to reconstruct.

**What this project does.** Evidence of Life connects planning and memory in one private SPA: you plan the day on a timeline, run focus sessions, attach moments (notes, photos, places, tags), track longer-term dues and habits, and browse history by time and map.

**Who it is for.** Individuals who want a self-hosted or privately hosted personal system — especially people who think in planned-vs-actual time and want an archive they own. Positioning is **design goals for ADHD-friendly execution**, not medical treatment.

## Features

Implemented in the current codebase (nothing invented):

- **Today / Plan dashboard** — day timeline, task planning, focus timers, planned-vs-actual views
- **Recap** — review what you actually did; optional AI “life replay” narrative when configured
- **Moments** — free-form capture with photos, locations, tags, mood, and links
- **Dues & habits** — deadlines, multi-step goals, recurring habits and streaks
- **Sticky notes** — lightweight personal checklists
- **Link hub** — saved links with server-side preview metadata
- **Map** — visited places with category hints (restaurant, coffee, park, museum…)
- **Calendar & year views** — browse history by day, month, and year-at-a-glance
- **Google Calendar sync** — OAuth import of external events into the timeline
- **Authentication** — Supabase Auth (email and/or providers you configure)
- **Reminders** — in-app / browser notification reminders (and email-typed due reminders in the product UI)
- **Smart input** — optional AI-assisted classification of free text / voice into moments, plans, or dues
- **Public synthetic demo** — `/demo-app` runs without a real backend for UI exploration
- **Evidence export** — JSON export helpers for user-owned data

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite 5
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (Radix primitives)
- React Router, TanStack Query
- Recharts, Leaflet (map), date-fns

### Backend

- Supabase Auth, Postgres, Storage
- Supabase Edge Functions (Deno): `geo`, `smart-input`, `link-preview`, `image-proxy`, `life-replay`, `google-calendar-*`
- Row Level Security on personal tables; private photo bucket with signed URLs

### Integrations

- **Google Calendar API** — OAuth connect + sync (HMAC-signed OAuth `state`, redirect allowlist)
- **Optional AI gateway** — `LOVABLE_API_KEY` for smart-input / life-replay (omit to disable)
- **Optional analytics** — Amplitude / GA4 public measurement IDs via `VITE_*` (client-side only)

Static hosting (e.g. Vercel) serves the SPA. Auth, data, and most server logic live in the operator’s Supabase project.

## Development Workflow

This repository was built as a spare-time, single-maintainer project with substantial help from AI coding assistants (including Cursor / Codex-class tools) for:

- implementing and iterating product features in React + TypeScript
- debugging type errors, tests, and CI failures
- refactoring hooks and view components without changing product intent
- drafting security hardening (edge auth helpers, OAuth state signing) and OSS docs
- accelerating PR-sized batches of documentation and quality-gate work

Human review remains the gate for merges, security-sensitive paths, and release decisions. AI did not replace ownership of architecture or privacy trade-offs.

## Local Development

### Requirements

- Node.js **20+** (see `.nvmrc`; 18+ may work)
- npm
- Optional: [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) for migrations and function deploy
- Optional: Deno (for `npm run test:security`)

### Install & run (UI)

```sh
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# fill VITE_SUPABASE_URL + VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY for full data features
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

**Backend-free UI:** [http://localhost:8080/demo-app](http://localhost:8080/demo-app) uses synthetic sample data.

### Environment variables

Client (Vite) — see [`.env.example`](.env.example):

| Variable | Required for | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | real auth/data | Project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | real auth/data | Anon / publishable key only |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` | convenience | Project ref |
| `VITE_AMPLITUDE_API_KEY` / `VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` | optional | Public analytics IDs |

Edge secrets (via `supabase secrets set`, never in the browser): `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `APP_URL`, `ALLOWED_REDIRECT_ORIGINS`, `OAUTH_STATE_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, optional `LOVABLE_API_KEY`.

Full migration + Auth + function deploy steps: [docs/oss/self-hosting.md](docs/oss/self-hosting.md).

### Quality commands

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run lint
npm run test:e2e          # Playwright demo smoke
npm run test:security     # Deno edge auth unit tests (needs Deno)
npm run build
```

## Future Improvements

Realistic, non-binding direction (also tracked in [docs/oss/roadmap.md](docs/oss/roadmap.md)):

- Live-DB RLS verification and complete account deletion coverage
- Stronger regression tests around timers, timezone rollover, and calendar sync
- Contributor onboarding: curated good-first issues and third-party self-host verification
- First tagged release with finalized notes (drafts live under `docs/oss/`)

**Non-goals:** medical/therapeutic claims; fake adoption metrics; growth-hacking the public repo.

## Deployment

The app is a static SPA (`vercel.json` rewrites to `index.html`). Build with `npm run build` and host `dist/`. Deploy Supabase edge functions separately with the Supabase CLI.
